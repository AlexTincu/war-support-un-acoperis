Together for Health is a platform developed by the M.A.M.E. Association with the support of the Vodafone Romania Foundation, with the aim of building the largest Solidarity Community. This will be a place of well-being, where we can bring those in need of help together with people who are able to help them. Therefore, if you are struggling with health concerns, this is where you can access important information regarding treatment and medical investigations, clinics and hospital here or abroad. You can also request help finding medicine, accommodation or about anything else you may be struggling with. And, if you want to get involved, here you can also offer help to those in need.
